      <h2>How to deal with proposal conflicts?</h2>
      <p>
        To avoid conflicting proposals, if a proposed idea contradicts a
        proposal currently under consideration, the Council may withhold the
        second proposal from voting until a decision is reached on the first
        proposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a proposal directly conflicts with an approved proposal, it should
        not be put forward for a vote for a period of three months following the
        implementation of the original proposal. This is put in place to
        minimize unnecessary expenditure of community resources.
      </p>
