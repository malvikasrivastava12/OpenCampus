      <h4>
        Below are the key steps that every proposal will have to go through,
        from ideation to implementation:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Ideation:</b> Submit your proposal and it will be reviewed and
            approved by an Administrator appointed by the Council. The
            Administrator will vet the proposal to ensure it meets the DAOâ€™s
            objectives and mission. If the proposal is not approved, they will
            notify you, and you will be able to revise the proposal and submit
            it again.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Comment Period:</b> Tokenholders will have the opportunity to
            review, comment and discuss the proposals on Discourse for 7 days.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Council Review: </b> The Council will consider whether the
            proposal should be presented to the tokenholders for a vote. The
            Council will only consider implementing the proposal would cause the
            DAO to breach any laws, regulations or duties applicable to the DAO
            or the mission of the DAO.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Voting Period:</b> Once the Council has determined to present a
            proposal for token holder voting, the proposal will be published on
            Snapshot and tokenholders will vote on it. The voting period will be
            open for a period of 7 days. If the proposal is approved, the
            proposal will move to the implementation phase. If not, it is
            archived for historical purposes.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>In Process: </b>Approved proposals that are still being worked on
            will be tagged as "in process", and the Council should provide
            periodic updates to the community.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Completed:</b> Proposals that are fully implemented will be
            tagged as "completed" by the Council.
          </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>
            <b>Archived Proposals:</b> Proposals that do not meet the threshold
            or are rejected during the Voting Period will be archived for
            historical purposes.
