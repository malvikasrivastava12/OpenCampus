      <h2>How was the Council selected?</h2>
      <p>
        The inaugural Council members are selected based on their industry
        experience and contribution to the protocol. The Council is meant to be
        interim in nature and after the initial 9 month terms, DAO members will
        be able to vote annually to either keep the current Council members or
        appoint new ones. EDU tokenholders are able to remove or replace a
        Council member at any time provided the proposal has been approved.
      </p>
      <h2>Does the Foundation or Council control the DAO?</h2>
      <p>
        They do not. The Foundation and Council are only responsible for the
        day-to-day administration of the DAO but not the decision-making
        process. The Open Campus community and EDU tokenholders are expected to
        actively contribute and participate in the governance of the DAO in the
        way of submitting and voting on new proposals.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the role of TinyTap?</h2>
      <p>
        TinyTap is one of the key contributors to the Open Campus Protocol and
        will continue to support the growth of the ecosystem in the future by
        building more products that utilize EDU.
